Roar, kid! shapes YouTube, Netflix, and Prime Video audio to a real
audiogram. Instead of a generic
equalizer, it applies **per-ear, per-frequency-band wide-dynamic-range
compression** modeled on how hearing aids amplify — quiet sounds boosted more,
loud sounds boosted less — with a hard output limiter that is always on.

Plot thresholds directly on an interactive audiogram drawn to clinical
conventions (red **O** = right ear, blue **X** = left ear), or import them from
a photo of a clinical report using your own AI-provider API key. Every imported
value is shown for review before it is applied, and every point stays editable.

> [!WARNING]
> **Not a medical device.** No diagnosis, and not a replacement for hearing
> aids or professional audiological care — especially for children. It is a
> listening supplement for mild-to-moderate loss.

## Features

- 🦁 **Interactive audiogram** — plot right/left thresholds the way an
  audiologist draws them, across the 8-frequency diagnostic standard
  (250, 500, 1k, 2k, 3k, 4k, 6k, 8k Hz).
- 🎚️ **Per-ear multiband WDRC** — a flat-summing Linkwitz–Riley crossover
  into eight bands per ear, compressed in an `AudioWorklet` with true RMS
  detection and per-band input/output curves driven by the plotted
  thresholds. Three selectable gain rules: conservative **comfort**, plus
  NAL-flavored **adult** and DSL-flavored **child** approximations.
- 🛡️ **Always-on brickwall limiter** — a look-ahead `AudioWorklet` limiter
  with a sample-accurate −1 dBFS ceiling, last node in the graph so nothing
  bypasses it, feeding an estimated listening-dose readout (ITU-T H.870
  conservative framing). Non-negotiable child safety.
- 🎧 **Optional calibration** — headphone presets, a reference-tone loudness
  match, and import of a correction curve measured with a cheap USB mic via
  `calibrate_playback.py`. Without it, gains are relative, not absolute.
- 📷 **Import from a photo** — extract thresholds from a clinical report:
  fully on-device via Chrome's built-in AI where supported (no key, the photo
  never leaves your machine — best on printed threshold tables), or with your
  own OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / Grok key; values are reviewed before
  applying.
- 🔒 **No server, no analytics** — thresholds live in your browser; the photo
  (if you use import) goes only to the provider you pick, under your own key.

## How it works

```
<video> ─ MediaElementSource ─ upmix ─ ChannelSplitter
   ├─ L: LR4 crossover [250 500 1k 2k 3k 4k 6k 8k] → WDRC worklet ─┐
   └─ R: same, driven by the right-ear audiogram                   ├─
        ChannelMerger → volume → look-ahead brickwall limiter → out
```

Default fitting rule ("comfort", deliberately conservative):

- gain at 65 dB program level = `0.45 × threshold(dB HL)` (half-gain-ish rule)
- compression ratio = `1 + loss/40` (recruitment compensation)

The `adult` / `child` selections apply NAL- and DSL-flavored approximations
instead (documented as approximations — the real prescriptive formulas
remain on the roadmap). A browser test harness in [`tests/`](tests/) checks
crossover flatness at unity, WDRC level-dependence, and the limiter ceiling.

Why not a static EQ? Hearing loss compresses the ear's dynamic range
(recruitment): quiet sounds need lots of gain, loud sounds almost none. Static
EQ over-amplifies loud passages; level-dependent gain per band is what real aids
do — this is a simplified version of that.

Full rationale, band math, and the 8-frequency (ASHA) basis are in
[`roar-kid/DOCUMENTATION.md`](roar-kid/DOCUMENTATION.md). For a study map of
every technology in the project — Web Audio, the audiology, the AI import,
the tooling — see [`TECHNOLOGIES.md`](TECHNOLOGIES.md) and its twelve
deep-dives in [`docs/tech/`](docs/tech/).

## Install

**From source (developer mode):**

1. `chrome://extensions` → enable **Developer mode**
2. **Load unpacked** → select the [`roar-kid-store/`](roar-kid-store/) folder
3. Open YouTube, Netflix, or Prime Video, click the icon, plot thresholds,
   press play.

Detailed local-testing steps and L/R troubleshooting are in
[`roar-kid/README.md`](roar-kid/README.md#testing-locally).

## Testing

The DSP itself — crossover, WDRC, limiter, calibration math — is covered by
a 32-check harness in [`tests/test.js`](tests/test.js), run headlessly with
real Web Audio (`OfflineAudioContext` and, for T7, a live `AudioContext`), no
build step or framework:

```
python3 tests/serve.py            # from the repo root
google-chrome --headless=new --no-sandbox \
  --autoplay-policy=no-user-gesture-required \
  http://127.0.0.1:8471/tests/test.html
# results land in tests/results.json
```

| # | Checks | What it verifies |
|---|--------|-------------------|
| T1 | a–h | Prescriptive curves: each target rule (comfort/adult/child) produces the stated gain, ratios stay monotone in loss, the band-gain cap holds, calibration offsets shift and clamp correctly, and adult/child land within tolerance of published NAL-R/DSL reference points (NFR-T.2). |
| T2 | — | Signal integrity: the 8-band crossover + WDRC, fed a zero audiogram, sums flat within ±1 dB from 100 Hz–12 kHz — silence-in-the-audiogram must mean transparent-in-spirit audio out. |
| T3 | — | WDRC behavior: at a flat 40 dB HL curve, a quiet tone gets more gain than a loud one — the entire point of wide-dynamic-range compression. |
| T4 | a–h | Limiter: worst-case input never produces a sample above the −1 dBFS ceiling (sample-accurate), the reduced child-mode ceiling holds, a message can never raise the ceiling, the legacy `DynamicsCompressorNode` fallback (used only if `AudioWorklet` fails to load) stays within a bounded overshoot of its own threshold, the anchor-derived child and adult ceilings can only ever tighten and hold under worst-case input, and the transient guard caps a sudden full-scale event, spares quiet content, and relaxes once the level proves sustained — SR-1, the limiter-is-last invariant. |
| T5 | a–b | Calibration round-trip: known headphone/tone/mic-correction offsets combine, clamp to ±12 dB, and land 1:1 in the output curves (NFR-T.4). |
| T6 | — | End-to-end processing latency (crossover + WDRC + limiter look-ahead), measured via the impulse response's energy centroid in an `OfflineAudioContext` — asserted inside the ITU lip-sync budget (FR-2.5). |
| T7 | — | Real A/V sync: a synthetic clip plays through the actual production graph and through an unprocessed baseline in a *live* `AudioContext`, using `requestVideoFrameCallback` and `getOutputTimestamp` to compare each against genuine video-frame display timing. The delta isolates what the extension's processing adds from the test clip's own encode jitter — the part T6's offline measurement can't reach. |
| T8 | a–c | Distortion (CTA-2051 §5.4): residual THD+N through the full chain — everything that isn't the fundamental counts, including the WDRC's non-harmonic modulation sidebands — stays below the 5% criterion at the moderate tone points (500/800 Hz @ 70 dB SPL, 1600 Hz @ 65), at the chain's maximum achievable steady output with the limiter fully engaged, and with a 100 dB SPL-equivalent input tone. Digital path only; what the DAC and headphones add is theirs. |
| T9 | a–c | 1/3-octave response smoothness by CTA-2051 §5.2's own local statistic — no band more than 12 dB above the mean of its neighbors ⅔ octave to either side, 250–5000 Hz — at transparency, at a representative sloping fitting, and at the steepest in-scope prescription (whose smooth slope passes the local criterion on its own terms; the band-gain cap check rides along). |
| T10 | — | Self-generated noise (CTA-2051 §5.5): digital silence through the highest-gain in-scope fitting renders below −68 dBFS RMS (the 32 dB SPL equivalent) — expected identically zero; the chain has no noise sources, no dither, no auto-muting. |
| T11 | — | High-frequency gain (CTA-2051 §5.6): the average measured insertion gain at 1.0/1.6/2.5 kHz with a 50 dB SPL-equivalent input at the highest-gain fitting matches the 35 dB figure published in `DOCUMENTATION.md` within ±1 dB. |
